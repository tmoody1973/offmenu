---

## INTRO (0:00 - 0:20)

**[SCREEN: App logo/splash or landing page]**

**NARRATION:**
> "Finding a restaurant shouldn't feel like homework. You don't need 500 Yelp results or the nearest Google Maps pin. You need a friend who actually knows where to eat.
>
> Meet Off Menu — your personal Food Butler."

---

## THE DAILY (0:20 - 0:50)

**[SCREEN: Daily Screen - scroll through the editorial layout]**

**NARRATION:**
> "Every day, Off Menu opens like a food magazine — not a search bar.
>
> The Lead Story features a narrative about a restaurant in your city. Today it's about a 22-year-old family recipe that's never been written down."

**[SCREEN: Show "Three for Tonight" section]**

> "Three for Tonight gives you context-aware picks. It's 7pm, it's cold outside, and the Butler knows you haven't had ramen in two weeks. Here are three options."

**[SCREEN: Show "The Adventure" card]**

> "And if you're feeling brave, The Adventure challenges you to try something new. You've had Thai six times this month — ever tried Burmese?"

## ASK THE BUTLER (0:50 - 1:40)

**[SCREEN: Navigate to Ask tab]**

**NARRATION:**
> "But the heart of Off Menu is the Butler itself."

**[SCREEN: Type a query: "Where do the kitchen workers eat after their shift?"]**

> "Ask anything. Not keywords — real questions. 'Where do the kitchen workers eat after their shift?'"

**[SCREEN: Show AI response loading, then results with personality]**

> "The Butler doesn't just search. It understands. It gives you real answers with real recommendations — written like a friend, not an algorithm."

**[SCREEN: Type another query: "Find tacos near me"]**

> "Ask for tacos near you, and the Butler knows to show a map."

**[SCREEN: Show map appearing with markers]**

> "It's context-aware. Discovery questions get maps. Menu questions get text. The Butler adapts to what you actually need."

---

## SAVE & JOURNAL (1:40 - 2:10)

**[SCREEN: Tap save button on a restaurant card]**

**NARRATION:**
> "Found somewhere you love? Save it with one tap. Off Menu remembers where you found it — from the Daily, from a search, from a friend's map."

**[SCREEN: Navigate to Journal tab]**

> "And your Food Journal tracks every visit. Build your own culinary story over time."

**[SCREEN: Show saved restaurants or journal entries]**

> "Because the best meals aren't just eaten — they're remembered."

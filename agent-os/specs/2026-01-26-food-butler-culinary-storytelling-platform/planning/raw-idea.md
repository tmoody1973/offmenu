# Food Butler - "Every Meal Has a Story"

## Vision
Transform from a restaurant finder into a culinary storytelling platform with AI that understands food the way Anthony Bourdain understood food - not as transactions, but as human experiences.

## Core Differentiators

### 1. Dish-Level Intelligence
- Find THE dish, not just restaurants
- "The best tonkotsu ramen within 20 minutes"
- Dish lineage tracking - chef training, technique origins
- Seasonal dish alerts
- The secret dishes - "skip their pasta, but the off-menu meatballs are legendary"

### 2. Culinary DNA Matching (Palate Profiling)
- Flavor affinities: umami-seeking, acid-loving, heat-tolerant, funk-friendly
- Texture preferences: crispy, chewy, silky, contrast-craving
- Experience style: counter seats, quiet corners, communal energy
- Adventure level: comfort-seeker to "I'll eat anything once"
- Match at molecular level to dishes and restaurants

### 3. The Food Family Tree
- Map culinary lineage of every restaurant
- Where chef trained, who influenced them
- Hidden connections between restaurants (shared suppliers, alumni networks)
- "This chef staged at Noma, then ran pasta at Lilia..."

### 4. Documentary Mode (The Bourdain Feature)
- Audio narration as you walk between spots
- Neighborhood history and cultural context
- Human stories behind the food
- Ambient soundtrack matching the journey vibe
- Turn every tour into a mini Parts Unknown episode

### 5. The Locals Network (Trust Layer)
- Chefs sharing where they eat on nights off
- Sommeliers revealing Monday drinking spots
- Line cooks exposing industry secrets
- Reputation built through accurate recommendations, not followers

### 6. Moment-Aware Intelligence
- First date vs. anniversary
- Celebrating vs. commiserating
- Adventurous friend vs. picky parents
- Solo contemplation vs. group celebration

### 7. The Anti-Algorithm (Serendipity Engine)
- "Surprise Me" mode that pushes boundaries
- Introduces cuisines you've never tried
- Embraces happy accidents and discovery

### 8. Time-Aware Recommendations
- Lunch menu vs. dinner menu differences
- Bar menu at 10pm secrets
- Happy hour transformations
- "The chef works Tuesday-Saturday"
- Optimal timing for each spot

### 9. Culinary Quests (Gamification)
- "The Ramen Pilgrimage" - 5 regional styles
- "The Immigrant Journey" - trace cuisine through neighborhoods
- "Counter Intelligence" - chef's counter experiences
- Progress tracking, achievements, shareable journeys

### 10. The Integrity Layer
- Sourcing transparency
- Labor practices
- Cultural authenticity
- Community involvement

## Technical Foundation
- Serverpod backend (Dart)
- Flutter Web/Mobile frontend
- Perplexity AI for deep research and storytelling
- Google Places API for location data
- Award databases (Michelin, James Beard)

## Current State
- Basic tour generation working
- Google Places integration complete
- Perplexity integration started
- Award matching system built
- Address autocomplete working

# Raw Idea: Award Badges

**Feature Name**: Award Badges

**Description**: Integration of James Beard and Michelin award data into the Food Tour Butler app. Display award badges on restaurant cards and map markers. Allow users to filter for "award-only" restaurants when generating tours. Data sourced from static datasets (GitHub: cjwinchester/james-beard, Kaggle: michelin-guide) with annual updates.

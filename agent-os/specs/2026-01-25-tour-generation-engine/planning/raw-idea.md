# Tour Generation Engine - Raw Idea

**Feature Name**: Tour Generation Engine

**Description**: Core algorithm for generating optimized food tours. Takes user preferences (cuisine types, dietary restrictions, budget, time constraints) and location, then generates a sequenced itinerary of restaurants optimized for digestion pacing (lighter to heavier dishes), geographic proximity, and dining time windows. This is the central feature that powers the Food Tour Butler app.
